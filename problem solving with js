Problem solving with JavaScript
1)Write a program to check whether the number is divisible by 2 and 3 and both(take prompt)
<script>
        let a=(parseInt(prompt("enter a number:")))
        if((a %2==0) && (a %3==0)){
            document.write("The number is divisible by 2 and 3")
        }else{
            document.write("the number is not divisible by 2 and 3")
        }
    </script>
Output:
Enter a number:12
The number is divisible by 2 and 3
2)write a program to find the largest number out of three numbers expected from the user
<script>
        
        let a=parseInt(prompt("Enter 1st number: "))
        let b=parseInt(prompt("Enter 2nd number: "))
        let c=parseInt(prompt("Enter 3rd number: "))
        if(a>b && a>c){
        document.write("The largest number is "+a)
            }else if(b>a && b>c){
                document.write("The largest number is "+b)
                }else{
                    document.write("The largest number is "+c)
        }
    </script>

Output:
Enter 1st number:12
Enter 2nd number:10
Enter 3rd number:1
The largest number is 12
3)Accept the following from the user and calculate the percentage of classes attended:
a)Total number of working days
b)total number of days for absent
After calculating percentage show that ,if the percentage is less than 75,then student will not be eligible to write exam
 <script>
    let a=parseInt(prompt("Enter number of working days:"))
    let b=parseInt(prompt("Enter the number of days for absent:"))
    let c=a-b
    let d=((c/a)*100)
    if(d>75){
        document.write("You are eligible to write exam")
    }else{
        document.write("You are not eligible to write exam")
    }
</script>
Output:
Enter number of the working days :100
Enter number of days for absent:24
You are eligible to write exam
Switch:
If 
Else
Elseif
Syntax:
Switch(variable expression){
Case value1:
//block of code for case1
Break;
Case value2:
//block of code for case2
Break;
Case value3:
//block of code for case3
Break;
Case value4:
//block of code for case4
