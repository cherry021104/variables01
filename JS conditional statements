Conditional Statements:
•	Set of Instructions execute line by line when the block of code is run
•	Block of code is executed when the instructions are true
•	If statement
•	If else statements
•	Elif statement
•	Nested statements
Conditional statements:
--To make the set instructions(block of code)(conditional block)execute only when the given condition is true.
--used to decide whether the code has to be executed or skip based on the given condition
--line –line(sequence)
Block of code: set of instructions
--it will execute only when that specific condition is true
Condition: An expression that evaluates an result(True or False)
Ex: console.log(5>6)

--Methods:
if
If-else
Else if
Switch
Ternary operators
	
If: only one possible condition:	

--if condition is true it will execute other wise it skip
Syntax:
If(condition){
---block of code
}
Key points:
1)condition means expression
2)evaluates true or false
Ex:
    <script>
        let a=5;
        let b=10;
        // 5<10 #True
        if(a<b) {
         document.write("hii Amrutha","<br>")
        }
        document.write("Welcome to India")
        //out of block
      </script> 

Output:
hii Amrutha
Welcome to India
Ex:
    <script>
        let a=5;
        let b=10;
        // 5<10 #True
        if(a>b){
         document.write("hii Amrutha","<br>")
        }
        document.write("Welcome to India")
        //out of block
      </script> 
Output:
Welcome to India
Ex:
    <script>
        let a=5;
        let b=10;
        // 5<10 #True
        //if(a<b) {
        if(a>b){
         document.write("hii Amrutha","<br>")
        }else{
            document.write("Ammu","<br>")
        }
        document.write("Welcome to India")
        //out of block
      </script> 
Output:
Ammu
Welcome to India
EX:
    <script>
        let a=5;
        let b=10;
        // 5<10 #True
        //if(a<b) {
        if(a<b){
         document.write("hii Amrutha","<br>")
        }else{
            document.write("Ammu","<br>")
        }
        document.write("Welcome to India")
        //out of block
      </script> 
OUTPUT:
hii Amrutha
Welcome to India
EX:
<script>
        age=prompt("enter your age?")
        name=prompt("enter your name?","<br>")
        if(age<18){
            alert(name+"you are too young to marry")
        }else if(age>35){
            alert(name+"you are too old to marry")
        }else{
            alert(name+"perfect age to marry")
        }
    </script>

Output:
Enter your age:19
Enter your name:Amrutha

Logical Question:
Write a program that reads a score A and B players and checks with one of the scores is greater than 300 and sum of the scores is less than 500 
Input:the first line of the integer contains an integer representing the score A and 2nd line of Input Contain an integer Representing Score B
PROGRAM:
    <script>
        let a=prompt("enter the score")
        let b=prompt("enter the score")
            if(a+b<500){
                document.write("You can team up");
            }else{
                document.write("You can't team up");
            }
    </script>
Output:
Enter the score:301
Enter the score:101
You Can team Up
